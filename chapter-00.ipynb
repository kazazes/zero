The president is eating ice cream and talking about a ceasefire. We're two years into this AI thing and I need to make some money. In this notebook. With you, dear reader, and the LLMs, and all the bots, past present and future, Copilot and GPT-4, Mistral & llama too. I hope you can run this locally, it's hard to say today where the compute will fall. I'm currently writing in Cursor, which means my AI du jour is some GPT flavor. The date is February 27, 2024.\n",
